# ItlwmCLI

ItlwmCLI is a small tool to directly interact with itlwm (the Intel WiFi driver for macOS). ItlwmCLI aims to be an intuitive yet more manual method than HeliPort. Note that this *does not* work for AirportItlwm.

# Changelog

## 0.0.0A

Initial beta.

# Compiling Yourself

Requirements:
- macOS (because it has specific header files for HeliPort)
- FTXUI header files accessible (I installed via Brew)
- Building statically with Qt
