This section of the project is made for machines running lower than macOS Sierra, or are running a 32-bit CPU (or both!). Since itlwm can be used on a lot of systems, you might as well be able to use it on a lot of systems.

- Mac OS X Lion (10.7) through macOS Tahoe (26).
- 32-bit *or* 64-bit CPU.

This is very similar to the main ItlwmCLI, but it has a few differences:
- It has an extremely simple TUI
- There's no graph or network list in the TUI
- There's no settings features (yet, if there's demand it's possible)

Other than that, it uses the exact same API as the main ItlwmCLI, so it should be able to do whatever the main ItlwmCLI can do. Please note that this project is in beta, so please use it at your own risk.
