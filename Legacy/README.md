This section of the project is made for machines running lower than macOS Sierra. The requirements for this version are pretty much the requirements for itlwm.

- Mac OS X Lion (10.7) through OS X El Capitan (10.11).
- 32-bit *or* 64-bit CPU.

Note that this project is not as maintained as regular ItlwmCLI, so it may not always work properly.
