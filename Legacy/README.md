This section of the project is made for machines running lower than macOS Sierra, or are running a 32-bit CPU. The requirements for this version are pretty much the requirements for itlwm.

- Mac OS X Lion (10.7) through macOS Tahoe (26).
- 32-bit *or* 64-bit CPU.

Note that this project is not *as* maintained as regular ItlwmCLI, so it may not always work properly.

This is very similar to the main ItlwmCLI, but it has a few differences:
- It has an extremely simple TUI
- There's no graph or network list in the TUI
- There's no settings features (yet, if there's demand it's possible)

Other than that, it uses the exact same API as the main ItlwmCLI, so it should be able to do whatever the main ItlwmCLI can do.
