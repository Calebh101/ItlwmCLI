Good luck I guess. I do have a few rules though

# Issues

Issues are for when you're not making a code change, or it's something minor like telling me there's a typo.

- No AI slop
- No duplicates
- Be nice, I'm not dealing with passive-aggressiveness or rudeness
- Have common sense, we're all human here

# Pull Requests (PRs)

Use PRs for actually changing code. If you try to submit big code/asset changes in issues, then I'll make you submit a PR. (I want you to be marked as a contributor!)

- No AI slop or effortless PRs ("Update README.md", etc)
    - You can use AI or update the readme, but if it's clear that you put no effort into your PR, then I'm rejecting it.
- No duplicates.
- Be nice, I'm not dealing with passive-aggressiveness
- Your code may be reformatted before being merged. I'm picky about my code haha, also please make sure to document it (yourself, not just asking AI to do it for you)
- **Any** libraries need to be credited in `README.md`, setup to install in the Actions workflow, and have the static (`.a`) version (for x64 macOS) in `/lib`, and linked from `/lib`. This tool working on macOS Recovery is a big thing here.
- Have common sense, we're all human here
